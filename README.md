I work on modeling default probability using score models like the COX model. My job involves Extracting, Loading, and
Transforming data, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and financial analysis on various ratios. Additionally,
I build classification models, including Logistic Regression (RL) and Random Forests (RF), to predict default risks.
